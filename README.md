Learning about advanced selectors in css
🎨 Day 7 – Advanced CSS Selectors (Course Registration Form Project)
This project is part of my Frontend Development Learning Series.
On Day 7, I explored and practiced Advanced CSS Selectors, learning how to target elements more precisely for styling complex webpages.

🧠 Topics Covered
🔹 Advanced CSS Selectors Learned
Child Selectors (parent > child) – Target direct child elements.
Descendant Selectors (ancestor descendant) – Target nested elements within a hierarchy.
Sibling Selectors (A + B, A ~ B) – Target elements that share the same parent.
Attribute Selectors ([attr=value]) – Style elements based on attributes and their values.
Pseudo-class Selectors (:hover, :focus, :first-child, etc.) – Apply styles dynamically based on user actions or element states.

📂 Project Overview
The project is a Course Registration Form that visually demonstrates the use of different CSS selectors.
Key Features:
Clean, structured HTML form divided into Personal Details and Course Details sections.
Visual cues and icons for valid/invalid fields.
Styling differentiation using child and sibling selectors.
Enhanced form interactivity using pseudo-classes (hover, focus).
Usage of attribute-based styling for input types and required fields.

🏗️ Technologies Used
HTML5 – Structure of the registration form.
CSS3 – Styling using advanced selectors and pseudo-classes.

💡 Learning Outcomes
Understood how different CSS selectors work together for efficient and organized styling.
Learned to target specific elements without adding extra classes or IDs.
